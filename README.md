# CPlusPlus-Data-Structure-Projects
Four (4) data structure related projects completed as part of an introductory CS class at UCLA.

**Project 1:** A zombie game completed from provided skeleton, with extensive use of pointers

**Project 2:** Implemented a **doubly-linked list**. A few implemented methods of the data structure include:
- inserting and deleting a node
- copying a list (with the = operator correctly overloaded)
- an algorithm finding the existence of a particular subsequence inside a linked list
- an algorithm interleaving two linked lists to create a new list
           
**Project 3:** Implemented the boardgame Mandala, including
- all the core game logic
- an AI player that makes thoughtful moves by using **a tree-based, depth-first search algorithm**
- the possibility of playing the game as a human player using simple input/output, with board visualization

**Project 4:** Implemented an algorithm that generates a minimum-sized diff file for two documents using hash table. 
- **coded the hash table data structure with all its methods** from scratch, per project requirement
- wrote an algorithm to generate a diff file given two documents, minimized diff file size by hashing a rolling window to find                as much repeated information as possible
- wrote a function to apply a diff file to a given document
